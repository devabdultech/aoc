# Advent of Code

Solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. This repository contains my solutions implemented in various programming languages (Hopefully). Please just bare with my solutions, can be huurtful to your eyes.

## Table of Contents

- [Year 2023](./2023)
  - [Day 1: Trebuchet?!](./2023/day_01)
  - [Day 2: Cube Conundrum](./2023/day_02)
  - [Day 3: Gear Ratios](./2023/day_03)

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by year and day. For each day:
- The `solutions` directory contains solutions implemented in different programming languages.
- The `input` directory contains input files for each day.

### Language Directories

Each `solutions` directory is further organized by programming language:
- `python`: Python solutions
- `typescript`: Typescriot solutions

And other languages I may be playing with - (Will Always come back to solve in othe languages)

## How to Locate

1. Navigate to the desired day and language directory.
2. Review the solution code (`solution.py`, `solution.js`, etc.).
3. Retrieve the input for the day from the corresponding `input` directory.
